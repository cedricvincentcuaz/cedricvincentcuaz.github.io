<p>Welcome to my website !

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Signal Processing Laboratory <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/">LTS4</a> of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">EPFL</a>, under the supervision of Pr. <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.frossard">Pascal Frossard</a>. I am working on Optimal Transport, Graph Representation Learning and its applications in Digital Pathology in the context of the <a href="https://www.sfa-phrt.ch/">PHRT project</a> .


I completed my PhD on <a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-04146481/document">Optimal Transport for Graph Representation Learning</a> in March 2023, under the supervision of Pr.<a href="https://remi.flamary.com/index.fr.html">Rémi Flamary</a>  at Pr. <a href="https://math.univ-cotedazur.fr/~mcorneli/">Marco Corneli</a>. Past then I was part of the <a href="https://3ia.univ-cotedazur.eu/">3IA Côte d'Azur</a> and
<a href="https://team.inria.fr/maasai/">MAASAI</a> team within INRIA Sophia-Antipolis Méditerranée.

Prior to my PhD, I graduated from <a href="https://remi.flamary.com/index.fr.html">ENSAE Paris - IP Paris</a> in applied mathematics and machine learning.
