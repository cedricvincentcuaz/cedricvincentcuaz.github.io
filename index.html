<p>I am a 3rd year PhD Candidate at INRIA Sophia-Antipolis Méditerranée within the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/maasai/">MAASAI</a> team and I am part of the <a href="https://3ia.univ-cotedazur.eu/">3IA Côte d'Azur</a>.

<p>I am working on Optimal Transport and its applications to structure data in Machine Learning such as Graph Representation Learning, under the supervision of <a href="https://remi.flamary.com/index.fr.html">Rémi Flamary</a> and <a href="https://math.unice.fr/~mcorneli/">Marco Corneli</a>. Prior to my PhD, I graduated from <a href="https://remi.flamary.com/index.fr.html">ENSAE Paris - IP Paris</a> in applied mathematics and machine learning. 

<p>I will defend my PhD thesis in early 2023 and I am currently seeking a PostDoctoral position. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research.
